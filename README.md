# Bank Management System  
Java Servlet-based role-based banking system with login functionality.
<br>
This is my class project :
develop a simple "Bank Management System"  : 

 a Bank Management System using a Java Servlet backend and appropriate frontend (HTML + basic CSS + JS) that has role-based Portal with separate Logins, with suitable permissions for different types of roles. It should implement basic operations for each of the users.

User Roles & Examples of Permissions :

- Bank Manager : Add staff, approve loans, authorize cheque payments, manage new customer sign-ups, and approve Fixed Deposit (FD) and Recurring Deposit (RD) accounts.
- Staff : Process deposits/withdrawals, approve updates to customer details, handle FD and RD account requests.    
- Customer : View account details, request updates to personal information, and apply for FD/RD accounts and loans.
